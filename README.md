# Custom Gazebo Plugins
- Just used the Gazebo-Classic API to create my own custom "model plugins" for fun (I learnt most of my cpp while doing this)
- Feel free to go through but as of 2025 the Classic Version Plugins are depreciated
- The custom plugin here is quite extensive and can act as a template for many other applications you can think off
- There is a diff_bot plugin in the main branch and a custom mecanum bot plugin in the [mecanum_bot_plugin branch]()

  > **Note** Will update a custom plugin version for Ignition-Gazebo or Gazebo Sim soon......
